    <p>Closure: A closure is a function that remembers variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has finished running.</p>

    <script>
      // Closure
      function outer() {
        let count = 0;

        return function inner() {
          count++;
          console.log('Count: ', count);
        };
      }

      const counter = outer();
      counter();

    <p>Event Loop: JavaScript can do only one thing at a time. But it can still handle things like waiting for timers or downloading data without stopping everything else. It does this using the event loop.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>JavaScript runs your code line by line (this is called the call stack).</li>
      <li>When it sees something that takes time (like setTimeout or fetching data), it tells the browser to handle it.</li>
      <li>When that task is done, its result is put in a queue (waiting line).</li>
      <li>The event loop checks if JavaScript is done with current work.</li>
      <li>If yes, it takes the next task from the queue and runs it.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <script>
      // Event Loop
      console.log("Start");

      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Waited!");
      }, 0);

      console.log("End");
    </script>
